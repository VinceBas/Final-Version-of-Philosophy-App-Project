		<p> -Ryan Holiday (born June 16, 1987) is an American author, public-relations strategist,
			bookstore owner and host of the podcast The Daily Stoic.
			He is a former director of marketing for American Apparel.
			He discovered Stoicism after reading Marcus Aurelius's “Meditations” when he was a
			19-year-old sophomore at the University of California, Riverside.
			He read it four times in a row and taped passages to
			his dorm room wall, over his bed.
			Ryan Holiday now writes and shares his insight extensively about the
			philosophy of Stoicism, on how He implemented
			it in his daily life and how it changed him for the better. </p>

		<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> “A Stoic focuses on what’s in their control and accepts what
			isn’t.<br><br>
			What’s in your control:<br>
			- what you do <br>
			- what you say <br>
			- what you think <br>

			What isn’t: <br><br>
			- what other people do <br>
			- what other people say <br>
			- what other people think” <br>
			-Ryan Holiday</p>
