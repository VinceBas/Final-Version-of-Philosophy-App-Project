		<p> -Bruce Lee, born Lee Jun-fan, was a Hong Kong American actor,
			director, martial artist, martial arts instructor and philosopher.
			He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing
			from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way
			for modern mixed martial arts. </p>

		<p> “Be like water making its way through cracks.
			Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall
			find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid,
			outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless,
			shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
			You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a
			teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”
			-Bruce Lee </p>
