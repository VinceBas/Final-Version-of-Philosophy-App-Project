		<p> -Lao-Tzu (l. c. 500 BCE, also known as Laozi or Lao-Tze) was a
			Chinese philosopher credited with founding the philosophical system of Taoism.
			He is best known as the author of the Laozi (later retitled the Tao-Te-Ching translated as
			“The Way of Virtue” or “The Classic of the Way and Virtue”)
			the work which exemplifies his thought. </p>

		<p> The name by which he is known is not a personal name but
			an honorific title meaning 'Old Man' or 'Old Master' and
			the debate continues as to whether an individual by that name
			ever existed or whether Lao-Tzu is an amalgam of many different philosophers. </p>

		<p> “Those who know don't talk.
			Those who talk don't know. </p>

		<p> Close your mouth,
			block off your senses,
			blunt your sharpness,
			untie your knots,
			soften your glare,
			settle your dust.
			This is the primal identity. </p>

		<p> Be like the Tao.
			It can't be approached or withdrawn from,
			benefited or harmed,
			honored or brought into disgrace.
			It gives itself up continually.
			That is why it endures.”
			-Lao Tzu </p>
